Powershell-Scripts
==================

Windows Powershell

Someof these tools are being incorporated into a single interface @ https://github.com/spmorton/AD-Tools

Some samples of powershell scripting

Proteus.ps1 - This is a basic interface into BlueCat Proteus
              Wrote this for work, its basic, has minor functionality but useful.
              Will be expanded in the future as the needs arise
